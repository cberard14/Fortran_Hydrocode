# Fortran_Hydrocode

** Please see the local wiki (linked in top bar) for a demonstration of the code at work :) **

Code written in 2015 -- it is a bit old and lacks commenting, a practice I
sought to improve with my special relativistic C++ code and Wiener Filter 2016 codes.

This code was written during my 4th year thesis project. It can accept a 
stellar density profile as input and track its evolution given an initial 
pressure distribution. There's a video of this in action! 

Trying to track the video down...
